Question 2. Dice Game Simulation
Simulate a dice game where:

Two players roll a 6-sided dice 5 times each.

Print each player's rolls.

Display the winner (player with the highest total), or say it's a draw.

âœ¨ Hint: Use random.randint(1, 6) in a loop.

    player_1_lst.append(random.randint(1, 6))
for i in range(1, 6):
    player_2_lst.append(random.randint(1, 6))

print(f"Player 1 rolls: {player_1_lst}")
print(f"Player 2 rolls: {player_2_lst}")

if sum(player_1_lst) > sum(player_2_lst):
