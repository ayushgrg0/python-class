Question 8. **Number Pattern Generator (Loops and Conditionals)**
Write a function `number_pattern(n)` that prints a pattern of numbers up to `n` rows,
where each row contains numbers from 1 to the row number, but only prints odd numbers.
For example, `number_pattern(4)` should print:
```
1
1 3
1 3 5
1 3 5 7
```
Use nested loops and conditionals to check for odd numbers.
